# programming-language-classifier

The purpose of this repository is to experiment with machine learning in scikit-learn to create a model that will
classify code snippets into programming languages.

Training data was procured from The Computer Language Benchmarks Game: http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/


The classifier was trained on the following programming languages:

* C (.gcc, .c)
* C#
* Common Lisp (.sbcl)
* Clojure
* Java
* JavaScript
* OCaml
* Perl
* PHP (.hack, .php)
* Python
* Ruby (.jruby, .yarv)
* Scala
* Scheme (.racket)
